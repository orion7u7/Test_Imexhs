# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 

## Overview

This project contains Python classes designed for managing patient and study records, specifically tailored to handle DICOM files. The `PatientRecord` and `StudyRecord` classes allow for detailed management of patient information and medical studies, including logging updates and loading data from DICOM files.

## File Structure

- `PatientRecord.py`: Script defining the `PatientRecord` class for managing patient information.
- `patientRecord.log`: Log file where updates to patient records, particularly diagnosis changes, are stored.
- `sample-02-dicom.dcm`: Sample DICOM file used for testing the `StudyRecord` class.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pydicom` library for reading DICOM files
