# Multithreading and Concurrency in Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates multithreading and concurrency in Python by implementing two scripts. The first script spawns two threads to print even and odd numbers alternately. The second script processes elements in a JSON file using multiple threads, normalizing data and logging the results in a thread-safe manner.

## File Structure

- `Even&Odd.py`: Script that creates two threads to print even and odd numbers between 1 and 200.
- `Threading&Concurrency.py`: Script that processes JSON data using multiple threads, normalizes the data, and logs the results.
- `json.log`: Log file where the results of the JSON data processing are stored.
- `sample-03-00-json.json`: Sample JSON file used for testing the `Threading&Concurrency.py` script.
- `sample-03-01-json.json`: Another sample JSON file for additional testing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
